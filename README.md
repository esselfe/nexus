Nexus is a 3D Linux program written in C using OpenGL/Mesa, GLU, GLEW and SDL2.  
The program renders a scene with multidirectional camera movement.  
Different modules can be implemented, like a file browser, text editor or memory meter.  
A low OpenGL version (1.1) is used so the project can be run on the most diversified/old hardware.  
The development status is currently in alpha stage.
